# Hello!

My name is Robin de Zwart, nice to meet you!

I’m a 4th-year student at SFU’s School of Interactive Arts and Technology, with a background in film and theatre, who derives immense joy from digital game development and computer programming. I aim to combine my passion for the arts with my love for technology and push the boundaries of storytelling beyond my wildest imagination.
