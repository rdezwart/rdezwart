# Hello!

My name is Robin de Zwart, nice to meet you!

I’m a 4th-year student at Simon Fraser University’s School of Interactive Arts and Technology, with a background in film and theatre, who derives immense joy from digital game development and computer programming. I aim to combine my passion for the arts with my love for technology and push the boundaries of storytelling beyond my wildest imagination.

Under my [other account](https://github.com/moukimyr), I also newly help maintain [Fluffy Calculator](https://github.com/fluffyCalculator/fluffycalculator.github.io), a calculation tool for a popular idle game, [Trimps](https://trimps.github.io/).
