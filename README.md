# Hi, I'm Robin;

I've grown a deep fascination with machine learning and artificial intelligence and have been steadily building my skills and knowledge over the past few years. :]

I'm nearing completion of a B.Sc. with a primary concentration on AI and Data Science for Human-Centered Systems at Simon Fraser University's [School of Interactive Arts & Technology](https://www.sfu.ca/siat.html). I have also gained experience in web/mobile development, various programming languages, and game design through completing additional concentrations.

I will graduate later this year and am eager to gain hands-on experience diving deeper into the training, fine-tuning, implementation, and ethical considerations of LLMs, generative models, and artificial intelligence as a whole.
