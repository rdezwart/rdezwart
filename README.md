# Hello!

My name is Robin de Zwart, nice to meet you!

I’m a 6th-year student at Simon Fraser University’s [School of Interactive Arts and Technology](https://www.sfu.ca/siat.html) with a concentration in Interactive Systems, and further interests in machine learning, video games, and cognitive science. I come from a film and theatre background and have been programming in various languages since late 2015. I love sinking my teeth into new projects, developing solutions to complex problems, and squashing any bugs I find along the way.

Through my previous positions, assignments, and personal projects, I am proficient in Python, Java, C++, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. I am also familiar with C, PHP, and SQL.

Under my [other account](https://github.com/moukimyr), I helped maintain [Fluffy Calculator](https://github.com/fluffyCalculator/fluffycalculator.github.io), a calculation tool for a popular idle game, [Trimps](https://trimps.github.io/).
